    <p>In March 1966, four months before the World Cup kicked-off, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen from the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster where it had been on display. Just seven days after it was stolen, it was discovered in a garden hedge in Upper Norwood, South London, by a chap walking his dog. That chap was David Corbett and his dog was Pickles – the inspiration behind our magazine’s name and a football hero.
    Pickles is an independent football magazine, that focuses on the culture surrounding the game, great football stories and issues that transcend the sport. Established in 2011, the magazine uses design and illustration to present stories in more engaging ways, as well as featuring great photography – presenting unique and original articles and offering a commentary on the modern game.
