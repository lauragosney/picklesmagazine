    <p>In March 1966, four months before the World Cup kicked-off, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen from the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster where it had been on display. Just seven days after it was stolen, it was discovered in a garden hedge in Upper Norwood, South London, by a bloke walking his dog. That bloke was David Corbett and his dog was Pickles – the inspiration behind our magazine’s name and a football hero.</p>

    <p>The magazine focuses on the culture surrounding the game, great football stories and issues that transcend the sport. Inspired by the beautiful game, we use design and illustration to present stories in more engaging ways, as well as featuring great photography – presenting unique and original articles and offering a commentary on the modern game. </p>
